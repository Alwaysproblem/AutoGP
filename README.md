# AutoGP: Automated Variational Inference for Gaussian Process Models
An implementation of the model described in [AutoGP: Exploring the Capabilities and Limitations of Gaussian Process Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05392).

The code was tested on Python 2.7 and [TensorFlow 0.12](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/os_setup).

# Setup
To setup AutoGP run the following command:
```
python setup.py
```

# Acknowledgements
The code to support triangular matrices operations under `autogp/util/tf_ops` was taken from the GPflow repository (Hensman, Matthews et al. GPflow, http://github.com/GPflow/GPflow, 2016).
